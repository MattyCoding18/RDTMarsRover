# 🚀 RDT Mars Rover Assessment

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a solution to the **Mars Rover technical assessment** provided by RDT. The goal is to develop a Python program that simulates the movement of robotic rovers on a plateau based on user input.

The rovers follow simple commands (`L`, `R`, `M`) to rotate left, right, or move forward within the boundaries of a given plateau.

## ✨ Features  
✔️ Accepts **multiple rovers** and movement instructions  
✔️ Ensures rovers **stay within plateau boundaries**  
✔️ Uses **modular OOP design** with a `Plateau` and `Rover` class  
✔️ Implements **efficient rotation logic** using modular indexing  
✔️ Allows easy **input handling** for dynamic testing
